# Demonstrator D8.3

This repository contains a demonstrator of the WID.smk and eutopsQC packages that can be used to compute smoking scores from methylation data.

A minimalist example of how to use the WID.smk packages is provided in its package repository on github: [WID.smk package](https://github.com/chiaraherzog/WID.smk). Here we provide a full example downloading matrix files from GEO, preprocessing them using the eutopsQC pipeline, and computing the indices alongside area under the curve computation.
